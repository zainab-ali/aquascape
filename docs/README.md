# Welcome to aquascape

This website is an alternative documentation site for [fs2](https://github.com/typelevel/fs2).

It uses diagrams, known as aquascapes, to illustrate the behaviour of fs2 operators. By reading the diagrams, you will learn more about the operators and streams.

Jump into the fs2 docs [here](reference/README.md).

If you write fs2 technical articles, try [using it yourself](how-to-write-the-diagrams.md).
